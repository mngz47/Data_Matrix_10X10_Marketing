I found myself without my employer, and his enigmatic last words echoed in my mind: “I can help you, only mom F can tell you the truth — it’s the snake.”

Without the luxury of seeking clarification, I dove headfirst into action. In just seven days, I brought to life what I now call the “F Snake.” No questions asked, just an intuitive response to a mysterious message. And you know what's interesting? The symbolism hit home because the first game on the iconic Nokia 3310 was the classic Snake game.

But the F Snake became more than just a game; it became a symbol of resilience, creativity, and a nod to the journey that took me away from Cape Town. It encapsulates the idea that even on day zero in a challenging scenario, you can forge something meaningful and extraordinary.

In the face of adversity, the creation of the F Snake wasn't just a project; it was a testament to turning challenges into opportunities, a way to navigate through the uncertainties of life. It represents the notion that even in moments of loss, you can find unexpected sources of inspiration and strength.
