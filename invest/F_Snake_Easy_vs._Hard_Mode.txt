Amid the challenges presented by the Covid-19 era, I found myself without my employer, and his cryptic words lingered as a guide: “I can help you, only mom F can tell you the truth — it’s the snake.”

Without the luxury of seeking clarification, I took swift action. In just seven days, I brought to life what I now refer to as the “F Snake.” There were no questions asked; it was an intuitive response to a mysterious message. Perhaps the symbolism resonated because the first game on the iconic Nokia 3310 was the classic Snake game.

The F Snake evolved beyond a mere game; it became a symbol of resilience, creativity, and a nod to the journey that led me away from Cape Town. It encapsulates the notion that, even on day zero in a challenging scenario, something meaningful and extraordinary can be forged.

In the face of adversity, the creation of the F Snake wasn't just a project; it was a testament to transforming challenges into opportunities, a method for navigating life's uncertainties. It embodies the idea that even in moments of loss, unexpected sources of inspiration and strength can be found.

So, here’s to the F Snake, a digital embodiment of resilience, an unspoken connection, and a reminder that, even in the face of profound loss, creativity can thrive, and meaningful legacies can be constructed. As an investor, consider the potential of this symbol in capturing the essence of overcoming challenges and the market demand for inspirational and meaningful content.
